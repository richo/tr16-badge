open in Codecomposer
import files from ccs_tirtos/tesla

build n flash

what theoretically works:
RF RCV

-the first tests failed, because I'm not sure what parameters i really need
what i conciously set was:
freq: 868Mhz (both-sides)
modulation: gfsk (both-sides: but here I'm not sure if they mean the same)
Sync-word: YSO-default xd391
packet-length: 30 (decimal)

settings can be found in the smartrf.c-file

One thing may be a problem:
on the YardStick i am only able to set a 16bit sync-word
the cc13xx _seems_ to need 32bit


what works:
TI-Display

what should work:
UART (tested on windows: comes up as COM, putty-connection spits out some values)
